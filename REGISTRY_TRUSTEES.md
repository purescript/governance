The [PureScript Registry](https://github.com/purescript/registry) stores PureScript packages and makes them available to package managers. The registry is mostly automated, but circumstances occasionally call for manual intervention. In these cases, the registry trustees are the only authorized people to make adjustments. The scope of their powers is [described in the registry spec](https://github.com/purescript/registry/#Registry-Trustees).

Trustees are appointed by the core team and can be removed by the core team.

## Current Trustees

- Fabrizio Ferrai ([@f-f](https://github.com/f-f))
- Thomas Honeyman ([@thomashoneyman](https://github.com/thomashoneyman))
